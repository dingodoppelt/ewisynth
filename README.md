# ewisynth
A simple LV2 oscillator plugin with lots of parameters for driving a breath controller such as an AKAI EWI
It uses DSP code from the DaisySP (https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP/) project which was itself ported from the Pichenettes Plaits oscillator (https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack/)
